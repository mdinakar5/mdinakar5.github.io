    "# Introduction:\n",
    "The 2020 general election was one of the most important and historical elections in the United States, having a record turnout since 1900 and with Joe Biden receiving over 80 million votes, the most number of votes received in history of any presidential candidate. Many new young voters in Gen Z were able to participate in this election and had a large influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall objective of this project will be to analyze data about the voter turnout in each state of the United States during the 2020 general election. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we will attempt to find potential trends between the voter turnout rate and state, the number of eligible voters and state, and how they correlate."

    "During this step, we will collect the data from websites/files. We have collected the data from https://data.world/government/vep-turnout, which got their data from each state's election site, and put it into a dataframe by using the pandas.read_csv function (more info at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). This allows us to be able to manipulate the data in the next step to look cleaner."
